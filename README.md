# **Star-Pattern-using-C**

Welcome to the Star Patterns using C repository! This project contains various star patterns implemented using nested loops in C. It serves as a learning resource for beginners who want to understand the fundamentals of loops, functions, and pattern generation in C programming.

This repository contains various star patterns implemented using nested loops in C. Each pattern is packed in a function, making it easy to generate specific patterns by simply calling the corresponding function with the desired number of rows. This project is done with the help of Code::Blocks.

``Introduction:-``

This repository showcases different star patterns created using C programming language. Each pattern is implemented in its own function, demonstrating how nested loops can be used to create visually appealing designs. These patterns are often asked in technical interviews and are great for improving your logical thinking and coding skills.
